# Examples

After learners have completed the study of basic knowledge, we will provide a series of selected practical cases to help learners understand and master the core technologies of large model application development more deeply. Through these cases, learners can explore and practice how to effectively use large models to solve practical problems based on actual application types. Our goal is to enable learners to master the technical points of large model application development more comprehensively and possess the ability to independently conduct secondary development or independent development of large model applications after completing our examples by providing these excellent large model application project demonstrations (Demo).

### [Chat-Huanhuan](./Chat-嬛嬛/readme.md)

**Chat-Huanhuan** is a chat language model that mimics the tone of Zhen Huan, obtained by **LoRA fine-tuning** based on LLM using all lines and sentences about Zhen Huan in the "Empresses in the Palace" script.

> Zhen Huan, the female lead in the novel "Empresses in the Palace" and the TV series "Empresses in the Palace", the core heroine. Originally named Zhen Yuhuan, she changed her name to Zhen Huan because she disliked the vulgarity of the word "Yu". She was the daughter of the Han Chinese Zhen Yuandao. Later, she was given the surname Niohuru by Yongzheng, raised to the Bordered Yellow Banner of the Manchu Eight Banners, and named "Niohuru Zhen Huan". She participated in the draft with Shen Meizhuang and An Lingrong, and was selected because she looked exactly like Empress Chunyuan. After entering the palace, facing the step-by-step persecution of Consort Hua, Shen Meizhuang being wronged, and An Lingrong's change of heart, she changed from a green girl in a corner to a veteran of palace fighting who could cause a bloody storm. After Yongzheng discovered the ambition of the Nian family, he ordered her father Zhen Yuandao to eliminate them. Zhen Huan also used her serial tricks in the harem to help the emperor solve political enemies, so she was deeply loved by Yongzheng. After several twists and turns, she finally defeated the arrogant and domineering Consort Hua. When Zhen Huan was conferred the title of Consort, she was plotted against by Empress Yixiu and was disliked by the emperor. After giving birth to her daughter Longyue, she was disheartened and asked to leave the palace to become a nun. However, she was loved by Prince Guo, and the two fell in love. After learning of Prince Guo's death, she immediately designed to meet Yongzheng again and returned to the palace in glory. Since then, the unjust case of Zhen's father was redressed, the Zhen clan rose again, and she also gave birth to twins. She escaped Yixiu's secret harm in various conspiracies such as blood test for paternity, and finally brought down the Queen behind the scenes by sacrificing her own biological fetus. But Yongzheng forced Zhen Huan to poison Yunli to test Zhen Huan's sincerity, and asked Zhen Huan, who had already given birth to children, to go to Junggar for a marriage alliance. Zhen Huan then regarded the emperor as the object that should be destroyed most. The finale said that "all human struggles are caused by the injustice of the rulers", and poisoned Yongzheng. The fourth prince Hongli ascended the throne as Qianlong, and Zhen Huan was honored as the Holy Mother Empress Dowager, with power over the court and the wild, and spent her old age in peace in Ruyi's Royal Love in the Palace.

Chat-Huanhuan realizes a complete process of creating a **personalized AI** fine-tuning large model based on novels and scripts with "Empresses in the Palace" as the entry point. By providing any novel or script, specifying the character, and running the complete process of this project, every user can create a personalized AI that belongs to their own, fits the character persona, and has high intelligence based on their favorite novel or script.

### [Tianji](./Tianji-天机/readme.md)

Want to learn large language model applications from scratch? Want to copy and paste code directly? Tianji meets all your needs; even, you can learn something unexpected.
Chinese culture emphasizes human sophistication, involving complex social rules, etiquette, and interpersonal relationships. The Social team provides coping methods, dialogue cases, and scenario simulations based on various Chinese-style cultural scenarios through in-depth understanding of Chinese context, cultural characteristics, and rich corpus.
Currently, the application scenarios supported by Tianji include: how to give **blessings, toasts, treat guests, give gifts, interpersonal communication, resolve embarrassment, and deal with conflicts**, etc., and more LLM EQ improvement plans suggested by community partners are in production~
In addition to treating this project as a fun social large model, you can also treat it as a complete full-stack large language model application introductory learning repository! You can learn **prompt engineering, agent creation, model fine-tuning, RAG data cleaning and use, and code specifications**... and other large language model application knowledge you need. After learning this project, you can quickly transform it into your own new large language model project. We look forward to you becoming the next master of large model application development!

### [Digital Life](./数字生命/readme.md)

This project will use "me" as a prototype and use a special dataset to fine-tune the large language model, dedicated to creating an AI digital human that can truly reflect my personality traits - including but not limited to my tone, expression, and thinking patterns, etc. Therefore, whether it is daily chatting or sharing feelings, it communicates in a familiar and comfortable way, as if I were by their side. The entire process is transferable and replicable, and the highlight is the production of the dataset.
